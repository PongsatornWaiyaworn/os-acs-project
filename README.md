# Scheduling Algorithms Project

The program simulates and compares the performance of seven Process Scheduling Algorithms: First-Come, First-Serve (FCFS), Round-Robin (RR), Shortest Job First (SJF), Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF), Priority Scheduling, Highest Response Ratio Next (HRRN), and Multilevel Queue with Feedback.

## How to run

1. Clone this repository
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PongsatornWaiyaworn/os-acs-project-Scheduler.git
```
2. Open `index.html` in your browser to start the application.

## Usage

1.  Open the application in your browser.
2.  Choose a scheduling algorithm to simulate.
3.  Input processes and their attributes (arrival time, burst time, priority).
5.  View the results in Gantt chart form and compare metrics across algorithms.
